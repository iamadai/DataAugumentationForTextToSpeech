# Data Augumentation For TextToSpeech
Introduce a method which do data augumentation for TTS AM model and Vocoder model training

I used this method to do data augmentation two years ago, It is useful for TTS. 

- If you AM/Vocoder model contain duration features, the method is useful
- If you AM/Vocoder model have fundmental frequency features, the method is useful
- If you Vocoder model is a Universal Vocoder, the method is useful
- If you want to simulate almost all range of ages and genders, the method is userful
- If you want to enrich prosody related performances, the method is not your expected. 

The method is not train a well-trained large-size AM+Vocoder model, then generate lots of synthsized data.
